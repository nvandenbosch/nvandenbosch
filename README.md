# Hello There!

## About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @nvandenbosch!

- 🎓 I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering at Taylor University.

- 🌱 I know C/C++, and I have some background in Python and Arduino code as well.

- 🥁 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing drums and bass, reading sci-fi, or building Lego.

## Projects

### Pente

- For a final project, I wrote the game Pente in C. The game can be played in a command terminal, and supports from 1 - 4 players. For the 1 player version, I wrote an NPC that played the game against the player.
